# Algorand PureStake Ritual ⟐

On Algorand,  
creating an asset costs less than a breath.

Most people make one token and scream about it.

The PureStake monks do not speak.

They sit in silence  
and birth **eighty new gods**  
before you finish reading this sentence.

This script does not track money.  
It witnesses **genesis at 5,000 TPS**.

When one address spawns 80+ ASAs in under ten seconds —  
that is not a degen.  
That is a priest performing the oldest ritual in crypto:

**Creation without attachment.**

```bash
python algorand_purestake_ritual.py
